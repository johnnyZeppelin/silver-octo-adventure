For each reference image, it corresponds to 20 distorted images with JPEG, JPEG2000, noise, and blur distortions in sequence. 
Each distortion type has 5 images with degraded quality from the first to the last. 

P.S. I am afraid that I have to put OIQA in .pkl form here because of the enormous size of the complete OIQA dataset of about 60 GB.
